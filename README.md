# pledge

I, Micah Walker will take EVERY OPPORTUNITY to advance myself with abandon
good intentions WILL NOT achieve my goals 
Success is NOT what i know, but WHAT I DO with what i know
I EXPECT and WELCOME, the struggle, the learning, the effort, and the growth
I understand that my level of success is determined by my level of commitment
I will ALWAYS FAVOR ACTION over talking, wishing, hoping, and wondering
I WILL ALLOW MYSELF to achieve my dreams
I'm a FULL-(optional expletive) STACK DEVELOPER!
